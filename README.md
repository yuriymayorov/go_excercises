# go_excercises
Project contains code examples of some popular algorithms written on Go Lang.
##[Arrays and strings](https://github.com/yuriymayorov/go_utils/wiki/Arrays-and-strings)
1. Implement an algorithm that deterimine if all characters occur once in string
2. Write a function void `reverse(char* str)` on C or C+. Function must do a cyclic shift of the string, which ends with null symbol
3. Write a function which detect if two string are permutation of each other
4. Write a function that compress string based on count of repeating letters
5. Implement an alhorithm that rotate matrix N*N
6. Write a function that set all M-col and all N-row values to 0, if value in point M*N is 0 
7. Imlement an algorithm that check if s2 is cyclic shift of s1
