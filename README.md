# go_utils
Project contains code examples explained in book *Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions* written on Go Lang.
##Arrays and strings
1. Implement algorithm which deterimine if all characters occur once in string
2. Implement a function void `reverse(char* str)` on C or C+. Function must do a cyclic shift of the string, which ends with null symbol
3. Write a method which detect if two string are permutation of each other
